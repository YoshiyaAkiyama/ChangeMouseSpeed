# ChangeMouseSpeed
Program for Windows, changes mouse speed.

Takes 4 values through commandline.
- speed
- threshold1
- threshold2
- Enhanced Pointer Precision.

When enhanced Pointer Precision is false(0), threshold1 and threshold2 is ignored.
Through the GUI, threshold1 and threshold2 are 6 and 10 respectively, and unless you want to test around, these values are recommended.
I typically just run this program through the attached batch file.
Because I'm not so comfortable with the track ball,  I use enhanced pointer precision with track ball (mctb.bat) and I typically game with mouse so (mcm.bat) has enhanced pointer precision off.
