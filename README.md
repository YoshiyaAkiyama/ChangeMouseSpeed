# ChangeMouseSpeed
Program for Windows, changes mouse speed.

Takes 4 values through commandline.
- speed
- threshold1
- threshold2
- Enhanced Pointer Precision.

When enhanced Pointer Precision is false(0), threshold1 and threshold2 is ignored.
When ehnaced pointer precision is enabled through mouse configuration GUI, threshold1 and threshold2 are set to 6 and 10 respectively.  I am not fully aware how threshold1 and threshold2 affects mouse movement.
I typically run this program through the attached batch file, which is config I use for track ball(mctb) and mouse(mcm).
